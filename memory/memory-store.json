      "value": "Added robust auth fallback to handle RLS.\n\nISSUE: Anonymous auth might not be enabled in Supabase, causing RLS to fail.\n\nSOLUTION: Multi-tier auth fallback\n\nAUTH FLOW:\n1. Check for existing session\n2. Try anonymous auth (signInAnonymously)\n3. If anonymous fails → Create test user (email/password)\n4. If test user exists → Sign in with credentials\n5. Log final auth state\n\nTEST USER CREDENTIALS:\n- Email: test@contractor.ai\n- Password: TestPassword123!\n\nLOGGING:\n✅ 'Anonymous session created' - anonymous auth worked\n✅ 'Signed in as test user' - email auth worked\n✅ 'Current authenticated user: [uuid]' - final auth state\n❌ 'NONE - RLS WILL FAIL!' - no auth, saves will fail\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Refresh browser\n2. Check console for auth messages\n3. If you see a UUID → auth worked, saves will work\n4. If you see 'NONE' → check Supabase auth settings\n\nFILE: src/lib/supabase.ts\nSTATUS: Build successful",
