# Stripe Customer Import Results

## Summary

**Total Stripe Customers Found:** 9
**Successfully Imported:** 1
**Skipped (No Auth User):** 8
**Errors:** 0

## The Real Issue

Your Stripe customers exist, but most of them **don't have corresponding users in your Supabase authentication system**. This happens when:

1. Customers were created directly in Stripe (not through your app)
2. Customers paid but never created an account
3. Emails in Stripe don't match emails in your auth system

## Detailed Results

These customers exist in Stripe but NOT in your Supabase auth.users table:

## Solutions

### Option 1: Create Auth Users for These Customers (Recommended)

Invite these users to sign up:

```
1. aaronjp743@gmail.com
2. grengadevelopment@gmail.com
3. mikah.albertson@elevatedsystems.info
4. info@rebelroofer.com
5. mikahsautodetailing@gmail.com
```

Once they sign up with these exact emails, run the import again:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk.supabase.co/functions/v1/import-stripe-customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [service-role-key]"
```

### Option 2: Manual User Creation

You can create auth users for these emails in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk/auth/users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Enter each email and create account
4. Re-run the import script

### Option 3: Link Customers to Existing Users

If these customers should be linked to different email addresses:

1. Update customer metadata in Stripe with correct userId
2. Or update customer email in Stripe to match existing auth user
3. Re-run import

## Next Steps

1. **Identify which approach to use:**
   - Are these real customers who should have accounts?
   - Are these test accounts?
   - Should they be merged with existing users?

2. **For real customers:**
   - Send them signup invitations
   - Once they sign up, their subscriptions will link automatically

3. **For test accounts:**
   - Delete from Stripe if not needed
   - Or create corresponding auth users

4. **Re-run import after user creation:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk.supabase.co/functions/v1/import-stripe-customers \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InVqaGd3Y3VybGxra2VvdXp3dmdrIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NzAzMjMyNCwiZXhwIjoyMDcyNjA4MzI0fQ.rMMvXy8uSuueeMY9EfBj0l5SXeLVPRFyPkNBIP77mck"
   ```

## Check Stripe for Active Subscriptions

To see which of these customers actually have active paid subscriptions:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers
2. Filter by subscription status: "Active"
3. Focus on importing those with active subscriptions first

## Current System Status

‚úÖ **Webhook Fix:** Deployed and working
‚úÖ **Import Function:** Deployed and ready
‚úÖ **Known Working Customer:** 1 with active subscription

üîÑ **Pending:** 8 customers waiting for auth user creation

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Re-run import after creating users
curl -X POST https://ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk.supabase.co/functions/v1/import-stripe-customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [service-role-key]"

# Check current database state
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stripe_customers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stripe_subscriptions WHERE status = 'active';

# View imported customers
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  u.email,
  s.status,
  s.subscription_id
FROM stripe_customers c
JOIN auth.users u ON c.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN stripe_subscriptions s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id;
```

## Questions to Answer

1. **Are these real paying customers?**
