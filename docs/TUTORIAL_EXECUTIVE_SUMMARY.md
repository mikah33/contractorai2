## Implementation Approach

### Technology Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **State Management** | Zustand (existing) | Already in project, lightweight |
| **Positioning** | Floating UI | Industry standard, intelligent |
| **Animations** | Framer Motion | Smooth, performant |
| **Build Approach** | Custom solution | Full control, smaller bundle |

**Alternative Rejected:** Pre-built libraries (Driver.js, Shepherd.js)
- **Reason:** Licensing costs, larger bundle, less customization

### Architecture Highlights

```

 └─ TutorialProvider (Context)
     ├─ TutorialOverlay (Portal to body)
     │   ├─ TutorialBackdrop
     │   ├─ TutorialSpotlight (SVG mask)
     │   └─ TutorialTooltip
     │       ├─ TutorialProgressBar
     │       └─ TutorialControls

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Performance issues | Low | Medium | Lazy loading, optimization |
| Browser compatibility | Low | High | Polyfills, graceful degradation |
| Accessibility gaps | Medium | High | WCAG audit, screen reader testing |
