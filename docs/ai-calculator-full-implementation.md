## Key Features Across All Calculators

### 1. Price Override Support
Users can specify custom prices when they know the exact cost:
- "I need flooring at $45 per box"
- "Concrete at $125 per cubic yard"

### 2. Intelligent Defaults
All calculators use industry-standard pricing based on:
- Home Depot/Lowe's retail pricing 2024-2025
- RS Means Construction Data
- National averages

### 3. Complete Material Lists
Each calculator includes:
- Primary materials
- Secondary materials (adhesives, fasteners, etc.)
- Optional add-ons
- Proper quantities with waste factors

### 4. Natural Language Support
Hank understands conversational requests:
- "I need 500 square feet of laminate flooring"
- "Calculate paint for a 2000 sqft house, 2 coats"
- "12x12 tile in a herringbone pattern for 300 sqft"

### 5. Price Edit Behavior (Fixed)
When user provides price corrections:
1. Clears all existing estimate items
2. Recalculates with new price
3. Shows complete updated estimate with ALL line items

Example:
```
User: "I need a 25x25 concrete pad 4 inches thick with wire mesh"
Hank: [Shows estimate with default $185/cubic yard]

User: "at $125 a cubic yard"
Hank: [Clears estimate, recalculates with $125/cy, shows complete new estimate including wire mesh]
```

## Deployment

**Deployed:** January 24, 2025

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Database Integration
Currently using hardcoded industry-standard pricing. Phase 2 will add:
1. Fetch user's custom calculator configurations from `custom_calculator_configs`
2. Load custom materials from `custom_materials` table
3. Load pricing overrides from `custom_pricing` table
4. Pass user-specific pricing to all calculation functions
5. Fall back to defaults when no custom pricing exists

### Smart Suggestions
