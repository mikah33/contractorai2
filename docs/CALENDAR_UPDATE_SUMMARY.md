# Calendar Feature Enhancement Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Feature:** Clickable Calendar Events with View/Edit/Delete Functionality

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Clickable Calendar Events**
All calendar events across all three views (Month, Week, Day) are now clickable:
- Click any event to open a detailed modal
- Events show hover effects and cursor changes for better UX
- Click events don't trigger the underlying date click

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/pages/Calendar.tsx`
  - Added `selectedEvent` state
  - Added `handleEventClick(event, e)` function
  - Added `handleCloseModal()` function
  - Added `onClick` handlers to all event divs in all three view modes
  - Added visual improvements (cursor-pointer, hover:shadow-md)

### 2. **Event Detail Modal with View/Edit Modes**
The EventModal now supports both viewing and editing events:

**View Mode (default when clicking an event):**
- Displays all event details in read-only format
- Shows Edit and Delete buttons in the header
- Clean, formatted display of dates, times, and status

**Edit Mode:**
- Allows modification of all event fields
- Shows Save Changes button
- Accessible via Edit button in view mode

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/components/calendar/EventModal.tsx`
  - Added `event` prop to accept existing events
  - Added `isEditing` state to toggle between view/edit modes
  - Added edit and delete button handlers
  - Implemented conditional rendering for all form fields
  - Added date formatting for view mode using `date-fns`
  - Added error handling with try-catch blocks

### 3. **Event Management Features**
Complete CRUD operations for calendar events:
- ‚úÖ **Create** - Add new events via "Add Event" button
- ‚úÖ **Read** - View event details by clicking
- ‚úÖ **Update** - Edit events via Edit button
- ‚úÖ **Delete** - Delete events with confirmation dialog

### 4. **Bug Fixes**

#### Issue #1: White Screen on Event Click
**Root Cause:** Database schema mismatch
- The `calendar_events` table was missing the `location` column
- The `end_date` column had `null` values
- Date parsing was using incorrect method

**Solution:**
- Removed `location` field from the interface (until migration is run)
- Made `end_date` nullable in TypeScript interface
- Added fallback: if `end_date` is null, use `start_date`
- Changed date parsing from `parseISO()` to `new Date()`

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/services/calendarService.ts` - Updated CalendarEvent interface
- `/src/components/calendar/EventModal.tsx` - Removed location field temporarily

#### Issue #2: Status Type Mismatch
**Root Cause:** Interface had limited status values
**Solution:** Expanded status types to include:
- `'pending' | 'completed' | 'cancelled' | 'in_progress' | 'delayed'`

#### Issue #3: Event Type Mismatch
**Root Cause:** Missing event types
**Solution:** Added additional types:
- `'delivery' | 'inspection'`

## üìä Database Schema Issues Found

### Current `calendar_events` Table Issues:

1. **Missing `location` column**
   - Interface expects it, but table doesn't have it
   - Temporarily removed from code until migration

2. **NULL `end_date` values**
   - Some events have `end_date = NULL`
   - Code now handles this gracefully with fallbacks

### Migration Required:

See `/docs/add-calendar-location-column.sql` for the migration script.

**To Apply:**
```bash
# Option 1: Run the helper script
./docs/run-calendar-migration.sh

# Option 2: Manual via Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
# 2. Copy/paste contents of docs/add-calendar-location-column.sql
# 3. Click Run

# Option 3: Supabase CLI
supabase db execute --file docs/add-calendar-location-column.sql
```

## üé® User Experience Improvements

### Visual Enhancements:
- Events now have hover effects (shadow and opacity)
- Cursor changes to pointer on hover
- Smooth transitions on all interactions
- Clear visual separation between view/edit modes

### Interaction Flow:
1. **Click event** ‚Üí Opens in view mode
2. **Click Edit** ‚Üí Switches to edit mode
3. **Make changes** ‚Üí Click Save Changes
4. **Or Delete** ‚Üí Confirms, then deletes

## üîß Technical Details

### State Management:
- Calendar.tsx manages `selectedEvent` and `showEventModal`
- EventModal manages `isEditing` and `formData`
- Clean separation of concerns

### Error Handling:
- Try-catch blocks around event data initialization
- Console logging for debugging
- Fallbacks for missing data
- User-friendly error messages

### Type Safety:
- Updated CalendarEvent interface to match database
- Proper TypeScript types for all event fields
- Nullable types where appropriate

   - Reason: Database column doesn't exist yet
   - Fix: Run migration script
   - Impact: Low - feature not critical

2. **Some events have null end_date**
   - Reason: Legacy data
   - Fix: Migration script updates these
   - Impact: None - code handles gracefully

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**

All calendar event interactions are now fully functional. The only pending item is the database migration to add the `location` column, which is optional and doesn't block any critical functionality.
