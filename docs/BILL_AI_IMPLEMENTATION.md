## How It Works

### User Flow

2. **Clicks "Talk to Bill"** â†’ Navigates to `/bill-project-manager`
3. **Chats with Bill** about employees, projects, or scheduling
4. **Bill uses function calling** to fetch real data from database
5. **Bill drafts emails** â†’ User reviews â†’ Approves/Rejects â†’ Sends

### Example Interactions

```
User: "Show me all active employees"
Bill: [Calls get_employees(status='active')]

      ðŸ‘¥ ACTIVE EMPLOYEES

      1. John Smith - Lead Carpenter
         - Rate: $85/hour
         - Contact: john@example.com | (555) 123-4567
         - Status: Available
```

```
User: "What projects are scheduled for next week?"
Bill: [Calls get_projects(status='scheduled') + get_calendar_events()]

      ðŸ“‹ SCHEDULED PROJECTS

      1. Miller Roof - May 20-25, 2024
         - Client: Sarah Miller
         - Team: Unassigned
         - Status: Awaiting materials
```

```
User: "Send an email to my team about the meeting"
Bill: "I'll draft an email for you to review..."

      ðŸ“§ EMAIL DRAFT
      To: [employee emails]
      Subject: Team Meeting Update

      [Draft content]

      Should I send this email?

User: [Approves] âœ“ Send Email
Bill: "âœ… Email sent successfully!"
```

## Database Schema

Bill AI connects to these tables:

### `employees`
```sql
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID) - Owner
- name (TEXT)
- email (TEXT)
- phone (TEXT)
- job_title (TEXT)
- hourly_rate (DECIMAL)
- notes (TEXT)
- status (active/inactive)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### `projects`
```sql
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID) - Owner
- name (TEXT)
- client_name (TEXT)
- status (TEXT)
- start_date, end_date (DATE)
- description (TEXT)
- budget (DECIMAL)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### `calendar_events`
```sql
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID) - Owner
- title (TEXT)
- description (TEXT)
- start_date, end_date (TIMESTAMP)
- all_day (BOOLEAN)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### `tasks` (linked to projects)
```sql
- id (UUID)
- project_id (UUID)
- title (TEXT)
- status (TEXT)
- assignee (TEXT)
- due_date (DATE)
- priority (TEXT)
- user_id (UUID)
```

## Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)
âœ… All tables have RLS enabled
âœ… Users can only access their own data
âœ… Service role key used in edge function for auth

### Email Approval Flow
âœ… **NEVER sends emails without explicit approval**
âœ… User must review draft and click "Send Email"
âœ… "Cancel" button to reject drafts
