**Error:** "Email rate limit exceeded"

## 🔍 What's Happening:

You're seeing **"Email rate limit exceeded"** - this means you've hit one of these limits:

### Possible Causes:

#### 1. **Supabase Default SMTP Limits** (Most Likely)
Even though you configured custom SMTP, Supabase may have reverted or has hourly limits:
- ⚠️ **Default SMTP:** 2-4 emails per hour
- ⚠️ **Rate limiting:** Based on email address or IP

#### 2. **Google Workspace SMTP Limits**
- ⚠️ **Hourly limit:** ~100 emails/hour
- ⚠️ **Daily limit:** 2,000 emails/day
- ⚠️ **Per-recipient throttling:** Multiple emails to same address

#### 3. **Testing Too Frequently**
- ⚠️ You may have tested signup multiple times rapidly
- ⚠️ Same email address used repeatedly
- ⚠️ Triggered anti-spam protection

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:

### Solution 1: Wait 1 Hour (Temporary)
**Quickest fix:**
```
⏰ Wait 60 minutes
✅ Rate limit will reset
✅ Try again with different email
```

### Solution 2: Verify Custom SMTP is Active
**Check if your Google SMTP config is actually being used:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk/auth/smtp
   ```

2. **Verify settings:**
   - ✅ Custom SMTP: **ENABLED** (toggle should be ON)
   - ✅ Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - ✅ Port: `587`
   - ✅ Username: Your Google Workspace email
   - ✅ Password: App password (16 characters)

3. **If toggle is OFF:**
   - Turn it back ON
   - Re-enter credentials
   - Save again

### Solution 3: Check Auth Users List
**See how many confirmation emails were sent:**

1. **Go to:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk/auth/users
   ```

2. **Look for:**
   - Multiple unconfirmed users
   - Same email repeated
   - Recent signups

3. **If you see duplicates:**
   - Delete test accounts
   - Wait for rate limit reset

---

## 🔧 PERMANENT SOLUTIONS:

### Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Testing Only)
**⚠️ Only for testing - NOT for production!**

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk/sql

-- Disable email confirmation requirement
UPDATE auth.config
SET mailer_autoconfirm = true;
```

**OR via Dashboard:**
1. Go to: Authentication → Settings
2. Find "Email Confirmations"
3. Toggle "Enable email confirmations" to OFF
4. Save

**Remember to turn back ON for production!**

### Option 2: Use Email Rate Limit Bypass (Development)
**Add this to your Supabase project (development only):**

1. **Go to Project Settings → API**
2. **Add development email to allowlist**
3. **This bypasses rate limits for testing**

### Option 3: Switch to SendGrid/Resend (Recommended)
**If you need to test frequently, use a dedicated email service:**

#### **Option A: Resend (Easiest)**
```
1. Sign up: https://resend.com
2. Free tier: 3,000 emails/month
3. Get API key
4. Configure in Supabase SMTP settings:
   - Host: smtp.resend.com
   - Port: 587
   - Username: resend
   - Password: [API key]
```

#### **Option B: SendGrid**
```
1. Sign up: https://sendgrid.com
2. Free tier: 100 emails/day
3. Get API key
4. Configure in Supabase SMTP settings
```

## 🧪 TESTING WORKAROUND:

### While Rate Limited, Test Other Ways:

#### 1. **Disable Email Confirmation Temporarily**
```
Set mailer_autoconfirm = true
↓
Signup works without email
↓
Test other features
↓
Re-enable for production
```

#### 2. **Use Different Email Addresses**
```
Test 1: test+1@gmail.com
Test 2: test+2@gmail.com
Test 3: test+3@gmail.com
(Gmail ignores +suffix, all go to test@gmail.com)
```

#### 3. **Mock Email in Development**
```javascript
// In authStore.ts - for testing only
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('📧 Would send email to:', email);
  return { error: null }; // Skip actual email
}
```

---

## 📊 Current Status Check:

### Run This to See Rate Limit Status:

```bash
# Check recent auth events
curl -s "https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/rest/v1/auth.audit_log_entries?order=created_at.desc&limit=10" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN:

### Step 1: Verify Custom SMTP (1 minute)
```
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ujhgwcurllkkeouzwvgk/auth/smtp
2. Check if "Enable Custom SMTP" toggle is ON
3. If OFF → Turn ON, re-enter credentials, Save
```

### Step 2: Wait for Reset (1 hour)
```
⏰ If rate limited, wait 60 minutes
✅ Use different email address for next test
```

### Step 3: Temporary Testing Solution
```
Option A: Disable email confirmation for testing
Option B: Use email+suffix trick (test+1@gmail.com)
Option C: Mock emails in development mode
```

### Step 4: Production Solution
```
✅ Keep Google Workspace SMTP (2,000/day is fine)
OR
✅ Upgrade to Resend/SendGrid for higher limits
```
