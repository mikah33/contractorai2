# ContractorAI PWA Installation Guide

## Overview

ContractorAI2 now includes an intelligent iOS PWA installation prompt system that guides users through installing the app on their iPhone home screen.

## Features Implemented

### 1. iOS Detection Utility (`src/utils/pwaInstall.ts`)
- Detects iOS devices
- Checks if app is already installed (standalone mode)
- Smart prompt timing (dismissible for 7 days)
- Android detection for future enhancements

### 2. Install Prompt Modal (`src/components/pwa/InstallPrompt.tsx`)
- Beautiful, animated modal with step-by-step instructions
- Shows Share icon and Add to Home Screen instructions
- Lists benefits of installing the PWA
- Auto-shows after 2 seconds on first visit
- Dismissible by users
- Responsive design optimized for iPhone

### 3. Install Button (`src/components/pwa/InstallButton.tsx`)
- Reusable button component with 3 variants:
  - `primary`: Full blue button
  - `secondary`: Outlined button
  - `minimal`: Text-only button
- Automatically hides when not on iOS or already installed
- Triggers the install prompt modal

### 4. Integration Points

**Landing Page** (`src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`):
- Auto-showing install prompt on page load
- Install button in navigation bar (minimal variant)

**Main App** (`src/App.tsx`):
- Install prompt for authenticated users
- Shows after login to encourage installation

## How It Works

### For Users on iOS Safari:

1. **First Visit**:
   - After 2 seconds, a beautiful modal appears
   - Shows step-by-step installation instructions
   - Can be dismissed (won't show again for 7 days)

2. **Manual Trigger**:
   - Click "Install App" button in navigation
   - Opens same instruction modal

3. **Installation Steps**:
   - Tap Share button (bottom of Safari)
   - Scroll to "Add to Home Screen"
   - Tap "Add"
   - App icon appears on home screen

### For Users NOT on iOS:
- Install prompts and buttons are automatically hidden
- App functions normally as a web app

## Technical Details

### Detection Logic
```typescript
// Auto-detects iOS devices
isIOS() // Returns true for iPhone/iPad/iPod

// Checks if already installed
isInStandaloneMode() // Returns true if launched from home screen

// Smart timing logic
shouldShowInstallPrompt() // Combines all checks
```

### Local Storage
- `pwa-install-dismissed`: Timestamp when user dismissed prompt
- Used to prevent showing prompt too frequently (7-day cooldown)

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Custom animations (fade-in, slide-up)
- Blue theme matching ContractorAI branding
- Mobile-first responsive layout
