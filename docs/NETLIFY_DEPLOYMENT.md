# Netlify Deployment Steps for contractorai.tools

## ‚úÖ Status: Code is Pushed to GitHub

Your latest changes (including Cindy CRM and Gmail OAuth) are now on GitHub.

Netlify should be auto-deploying them right now!

---

## Step 1: Check Deployment Status

### Go to Netlify Dashboard:
```
https://app.netlify.com/
```

### What to Look For:

1. **Find your site** (probably named "contractorai2" or similar)

2. **Check deployment status:**
   - üü° **Yellow/Building** = Deployment in progress (wait 2-5 minutes)
   - ‚úÖ **Green/Published** = Deployment complete
   - ‚ùå **Red/Failed** = Deployment error (check logs)

3. **Look at "Production deploys"** section:
   - Should show latest commit: `9bc367d - Add Gmail OAuth integration and Cindy AI CRM chatbot`
   - If you see this commit, the deployment is happening or done!

---

## Step 2: Add Production Environment Variables (CRITICAL!)

**BEFORE** the deployment finishes, add these environment variables:

### Go to Site Settings:
1. Click your site in Netlify dashboard
2. Click **"Site configuration"** ‚Üí **"Environment variables"**
3. Click **"Add a variable"** ‚Üí **"Add a single variable"**

### Add These Variables:

**Variable 1: Google Client ID**
- **Key**: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- **Value**: `244912967505-80c3fhnvgiedfti5mutmlisqk17nugl4.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- Click **"Create variable"**

**Variable 2: Gmail Redirect URI**
- **Key**: `VITE_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI`
- **Value**: `https://contractorai.tools/gmail-oauth-callback`
- Click **"Create variable"**

### Verify Existing Variables:

Make sure these are already set (they should be):
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

---

## Step 3: Trigger Redeploy (If Needed)

If the deployment finished BEFORE you added the environment variables:

1. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** dropdown
3. Select **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for rebuild

This ensures the new environment variables are included in the build.

---

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

After deployment is complete (green checkmark):

### Test 1: Check Cindy is Available
```
https://contractorai.tools/ai-team
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Cindy card shows **"Talk to Cindy"** button
- ‚ùå NO "Under Construction" badge

### Test 2: Open Cindy CRM
```
https://contractorai.tools/cindy-crm
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Cindy chat interface loads
- ‚úÖ Can ask questions and get responses
- ‚úÖ Quick Info sidebar shows stats

### Test 3: Gmail OAuth (After connecting)
```
https://contractorai.tools/settings
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ "Email Integration" section visible
- ‚úÖ "Connect Gmail Account" button works
- ‚úÖ OAuth popup opens with production redirect

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Deployment is "Building" for over 10 minutes
**Fix:**
1. Click on the deployment
2. Check "Deploy log" for errors
3. Common issues:
   - TypeScript errors
   - Missing dependencies
   - Build timeout

### Issue: Deployment Failed
**Fix:**
1. Click on failed deployment
2. Read the error log (scroll to red text)
3. Usually shows specific error
4. Common fixes:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Node version mismatch
   - Build command issues

### Issue: Cindy still shows "Under Construction"
**Cause:** Browser cache or old deployment

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify deployment timestamp matches your push time
4. Check deployed commit matches GitHub (9bc367d)

### Issue: Gmail OAuth fails with redirect_uri_mismatch
**Cause:** Environment variable not set correctly

**Fix:**
1. Verify `VITE_GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI` in Netlify settings
2. Should be exactly: `https://contractorai.tools/gmail-oauth-callback`
3. No trailing slash
4. Redeploy after fixing
