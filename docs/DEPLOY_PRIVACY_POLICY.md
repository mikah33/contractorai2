## üì¶ Option 2: GitHub Pages (5 Minutes)

If you want to use GitHub:

cd /Users/mikahalbertson/git/ContractorAI/contractorai2

# Add privacy policy
git add privacy.html
git commit -m "Add privacy policy for App Store"
git push

# Enable GitHub Pages:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/contractorai2/settings/pages
# 2. Source: Deploy from branch
# 3. Branch: main (or master)
# 4. Folder: / (root)
# 5. Click Save

# Your URL will be:
# https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/contractorai2/privacy.html
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy, then visit your URL.

## üåê Option 3: Vercel (2 Minutes)

# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Deploy

## üîó Option 4: Add to EarlySignupContractorAI Website

If you can find the deployed EarlySignupContractorAI directory:

```bash
# Once you locate the directory, copy privacy.html there:
cp /Users/mikahalbertson/git/ContractorAI/contractorai2/privacy.html \
   /path/to/EarlySignupContractorAI/privacy.html

# Then deploy using the website's deployment method
# Your URL will be: https://[your-domain]/privacy.html
```

**What's the URL of your EarlySignup website?**
- If it's on Netlify, Vercel, or another platform, we can add the privacy.html file there

---

## ‚úÖ Verify It Works

After deploying, test the URL:

```bash
# Replace with your actual URL
curl -I https://your-url.com/privacy.html

# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Or just open it in a browser:
```bash
open https://your-url.com/privacy.html
```

## üìã For App Store Connect

Once deployed, use the URL in App Store Connect:

**Section:** App Privacy ‚Üí Privacy Policy URL
**Enter:** `https://your-deployed-url.com/privacy.html`

---

## üÜò Can't Find EarlySignup Website?

**Tell me:**
1. What's the live URL of your early signup page?
2. How is it currently deployed? (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, other?)
3. Do you have access to the deployment dashboard?

Then I can give you exact instructions for adding the privacy policy there.

**OR** just use **Option 1 (Netlify Drop)** - it takes 2 minutes and works perfectly!
